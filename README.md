# Spring Boot REST API with PostgreSQL, Docker, and OpenAI Integration

## Overview
This project is a **Spring Boot REST API** built with **Java 21** that demonstrates how to develop clean, testable, and scalable backend services.  
It connects to a **PostgreSQL** database running inside **Docker**, uses **Spring Data JPA** for database interactions, and integrates with the **OpenAI API**.

The API supports full **CRUD** operations — `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` — and is designed to be easily extendable for production use.
